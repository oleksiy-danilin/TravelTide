Below there's a just a couple of Excel formulae examples that were used in the "Perk Model". Fore more formulae regarding feature engineering and data normalization in Excel look the xlxs-file,
which is uploaded in this same branch.

Conditional function to chose an appropriate behavioural segment:

=IF(
    MIN(Table1[@[RANK: Flight Bargain Seeking Index]:[RANK: Flexible Traveler Index]])=[@[RANK: Flight Bargain Seeking Index]],
    "Flight Bargain Hunter",
    IF(
        MIN(Table1[@[RANK: Flight Bargain Seeking Index]:[RANK: Flexible Traveler Index]])=[@[RANK: Hotel Bargain Seeking Index]],
        "Hotel Bargain Hunter",
        IF(
            MIN(Table1[@[RANK: Flight Bargain Seeking Index]:[RANK: Flexible Traveler Index]])=[@[RANK: Combined Booking Index]],
            "Combined Booker",
            IF(
                MIN(Table1[@[RANK: Flight Bargain Seeking Index]:[RANK: Flexible Traveler Index]])=[@[RANK: Hotel Only Booking Index]],
                "Hotel Only Booker",
                IF(
                    MIN(Table1[@[RANK: Flight Bargain Seeking Index]:[RANK: Flexible Traveler Index]])=[@[RANK: Heavy Packer Index]],
                    "Heavy Packer",
                    IF(
                        MIN(Table1[@[RANK: Flight Bargain Seeking Index]:[RANK: Flexible Traveler Index]])=[@[RANK: Flexible Traveler Index]],
                        "Flexible Traveler",
                        "Passive Deal Seeker"
                    )
                )
            )
        )
    )
)

Conditional function to assign an appropriate perk

=IF(MIN(Table1[@[RANK: Browsing Activity Index]:[RANK: Flexible Traveler Index]])=[@[RANK: Browsing Activity Index]], "Exclusive Discount on Any First Booking", 
IF(MIN(Table1[@[RANK: Browsing Activity Index]:[RANK: Flexible Traveler Index]])=[@[RANK: Flight Bargain Seeking Index]], "Exclusive Flight Discount", 
IF(MIN(Table1[@[RANK: Browsing Activity Index]:[RANK: Flexible Traveler Index]])=[@[RANK: Hotel Bargain Seeking Index]], "Exclusive Hotel Discount", 
IF(MIN(Table1[@[RANK: Browsing Activity Index]:[RANK: Flexible Traveler Index]])=[@[RANK: Combined Booking Index]], "One Night Free Hotel with Flight", 
IF(MIN(Table1[@[RANK: Browsing Activity Index]:[RANK: Flexible Traveler Index]])=[@[RANK: Hotel Only Booking Index]], "Free Hotel Meal", 
IF(MIN(Table1[@[RANK: Browsing Activity Index]:[RANK: Flexible Traveler Index]])=[@[RANK: Heavy Packer Index]], "Free Checked Bag", 
IF(MIN(Table1[@[RANK: Browsing Activity Index]:[RANK: Flexible Traveler Index]])=[@[RANK: Flexible Traveler Index]], "No Cancellation Fee")))))))
